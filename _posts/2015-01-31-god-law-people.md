The world is now in agony like it was never before. Hopelessness, restlessness, rejection, pain and suffering is all around the world today. World war or inquisitions may be gone, but sufferings are ever present in different sizes and shapes. Though human lives have better standing today, spiritual lives have declined so significantly. 

The world changed in just a matter of decades. How did it happen so quickly? Today, we see some of the Word of God in our laws but God Himself is precluded in our Constitution. The laws today have maintained some of God's standard of morality but human laws altered some of it to fit in to the "trend of the world." God designed marriage to be for a lifetime but today divorce is acceptable. A lot of research has shown that living in a broken home correlates with a higher tendency of criminal offenses among offenders. The world suffers because God, the author of the justice, has been precluded. But it was written in the Bible that lawlessness would surely come before Jesus' coming. 

As a Christian, how do we stand against the tide of this world?  

#### 1. God is the source of our strength 
> 13  I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.Philippians 4:13 (KJV)


_Acknowledging that we are never strong enough on our own shall teach us to trust God._ 
_Do you ever marvel how the universe stays in tact, how stars do not bang each other? It is God's strength that binds them together. If we have God's strength it will be enough for us to 
#### 2. Put to Heart God's Standards

#### 3. Learn to fear God

#### 4. Pray, pray, pray




When the world has pained you and you feel like no one is going help you, remember God. If you don't believe that there is God, why not assume that there is God. If it seems like you have been a faithful Christian or is battling a secret sin, remember God. Nothing will be taken from you when you try to go that closed room, down on your knees and with your heart broken.
